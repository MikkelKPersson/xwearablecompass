I feel much comfortable in c# ) so I picked Xamarin for android wear app. As making android app in Xamarin exactly same as compared to android development in official Android Studio or Eclipse. The plus point is that you can use many C# functions which is real beauty of Xamarin Studio.  some high level advantages of Xamarin

- Xamarin is integrated with SDKs of all of the different operating systems
- Best Native experience app
- Single codebase share to all mobile platform
